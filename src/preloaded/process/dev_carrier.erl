%%% @doc A name: a token with a single unit, whose holder decides what the
%%% name resolves to.
%%%
%%% The device is `token-1.0''s shape carrying `~reference@1.0''s payload. From
%%% the token it takes the state layout -- `name', `ticker', `denomination',
%%% `total-supply' and `balances' on a flat `~process@1.0' message -- the
%%% `transfer' action and its notices, and the rule that decides who may `set':
%%% the holder of the whole supply. From the reference it takes what `set'
%%% actually writes -- a linked message whose keys the name then resolves
%%% through to.
%%%
%%% Because the supply is one indivisible unit, those two things compose into a
%%% name: exactly one address holds it, that address alone may say what the name
%%% points at, and transferring the unit hands over that right with it. Selling
%%% the unit -- with `~arweave-swap@1.0', which settles against the same
%%% `balances' -- sells the name.
%%%
%%% The protocol is two messages:
%%% <ul>
%%%   <li>`transfer', carrying `recipient' and `quantity'. The sender is the
%%%       message's signer. A `Debit-Notice' and a `Credit-Notice' are emitted
%%%       with the same keys `token-1.0' uses.</li>
%%%   <li>`set', carrying either a `reference-value' -- the message the name is
%%%       to resolve to -- or nothing, in which case the name inherits the keys
%%%       of the `set' message itself, as `~reference@1.0' defines it. Only the
%%%       holder of the whole supply may send it, judged against the balances as
%%%       they stand at that slot.</li>
%%% </ul>
%%%
%%% There is no mint path, so the supply is fixed at spawn: a name cannot be
%%% diluted into existing twice.
%%%
%%% Ordering is the schedule's. `~reference@1.0' has to reconstruct which of
%%% several competing `set's won -- by a signer-declared timestamp, tie-broken
%%% by weave position -- because it is assembled from loose layer-1 messages. A
%%% process is handed that order already: the latest `set' in slot order wins,
%%% and there is nothing to declare and nothing to tie-break.
%%%
%%% Reads fall through to the linked value, as they do in `~reference@1.0'.
%%% Every scheduler assignment is explicitly routed to `compute', so a
%%% base-layer transaction's `path' is data and cannot select a device key.
