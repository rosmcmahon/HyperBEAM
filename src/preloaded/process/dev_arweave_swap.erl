%%% @doc A device for selling a process's tokens for native Arweave value.
%%%
%%% The two halves of the trade live in different places, and that asymmetry
%%% is the whole design. The token half lives here: this device debits and
%%% credits the `balances' submessage that a `~token@1.0' implementation keeps
%%% in the same process's base, so it can hold tokens in escrow and pay them
%%% out with certainty. The Arweave half does not live here at all -- AR moves
%%% directly from buyer to seller as an ordinary layer-1 transfer, which no
%%% process can hold, redirect or refund.
%%%
%%% A process using this device is sequenced by `~arweave-scheduler@1.0'.
%%% Control transactions target the process directly. A payment between two
%%% addresses names the process in its `Assign-To' tag, so it also becomes a
%%% slot that the process can settle against. Its process message reads:
%%% <pre>
%%%     scheduler-device: arweave-scheduler@1.0
%%%     execution-device: arweave-swap@1.0
%%% </pre>
%%%
%%% The protocol is four messages:
%%% <ul>
%%%   <li>`make-offer' (to the process, from the seller), carrying
%%%       `offer-quantity' in token units, `asking' in winston, and what the
%%%       seller asks of a buyer to reserve it: a `minimum-fee' in winston, a
%%%       `deposit' in token units, and a `deadline' in blocks. Any of the
%%%       three may be zero. The `offer-quantity' moves into escrow at once, so
%%%       delivery is never in doubt: the goods are held before any buyer
%%%       commits anything, and the seller stakes nothing further. The offered
%%%       amount cannot be called `quantity': that is a transaction's own value
%%%       field, so the codec would carry it as winston of AR sent to the
%%%       process -- an address with no key, which would destroy it.</li>
%%%   <li>`register-interest' (to the process, from a buyer), naming an
%%%       `order-id' and optionally a `fill-quantity' (the whole offer by
%%%       default). A partial registration reserves that slice while its
%%%       remainder stays open under the registration's id. For `deadline' blocks
%%%       the slice is that buyer's alone and the seller
%%%       cannot withdraw it. That window is what makes paying safe -- without
%%%       it a buyer races the seller's withdrawal, having already sent AR that
%%%       nobody can claw back. Registering pays the order's `minimum-fee' as
%%%       the registration's own transaction `reward', which sends it where
%%%       Arweave sends rewards -- to miners and the endowment -- rather than
%%%       stranding it at the process's address, which is a transaction id with
%%%       no key behind it. Being denominated in AR it asks nothing of a buyer
%%%       who holds none of the token.</li>
%%%   <li>`cancel-order' (to the process, from the seller), naming an
%%%       `order-id'. Returns the escrowed goods and removes the offer. It is
%%%       refused while a reservation stands.</li>
%%%   <li>The payment itself: an ordinary transfer whose `target' is the
%%%       order's `recipient', whose `quantity' is at least the `asking'
%%%       winston, tagged with the `order-id' and with `Assign-To' naming the
%%%       process.</li>
%%% </ul>
%%%
%%% An offer does not expire: it stands until its seller withdraws it or a
%%% buyer completes it.
%%%
%%% The `deposit' is the <em>buyer's</em> collateral against taking exclusivity
%%% and then abandoning it -- pledged when they register, returned when they
%%% pay, forfeit to the seller when their reservation lapses unpaid. It is
%%% denominated in the process's own token because that is the only thing this
%%% device can decline to honour: a registration naming an offer that is
%%% already gone takes nothing. AR could not serve, because AR settles on the
%%% weave whatever any process decides.
%%%
%%% Paying an open offer without registering first is permitted and unwise:
%%% the seller may withdraw, or another buyer complete it, while the payment is
%%% in flight.
%%%
%%% The book holds live offers only, so opening an offer and withdrawing it
%%% leaves the process exactly as it was. Escrowed goods, pledged collateral
%%% and balances always sum to the supply.
%%%
%%% Reservations are measured in Arweave block heights, read from the
%%% `block-height' that scheduler assignments carry. That is the only clock the
%%% device has, and deliberately so: reading the chain tip during a compute
%%% would be non-deterministic, and `~process@1.0' caches every slot result
%%% forever. A quiet process advances lazily on its next relevant transaction.

%% @doc Every state transition in this device is driven by the schedule, never
%% by a direct request, so every key routes to `compute'.
%%
%% Scheduler assignments explicitly route to `compute', but the device also
%% remains safe if a caller selects another key. So there is no `exports' list:
%% a key outside it would fall through to `~message@1.0', answer `not_found',
%% fail its slot and wedge the process permanently. There is no `excludes' list
%% either, since an excluded `set' or `keys' would let `~message@1.0' replace the
%% process's own state. `set' is therefore implemented here.
%%
%% `info' is deliberately arity 0. A device's `info' is always exported, and had
%% it taken the base as an argument it would also answer the `info' key, so a
%% transaction tagged `path: info' would replace the process state with this
%% map.

%% @doc Setting the device is honoured, and nothing else is. `lib_process' puts
%% the process's own device back with a `set' after every slot, and reading the
%% state as a message is itself a device set, so refusing those would leave the
%% device unable to read itself. A scheduled message that asks to be routed to
%% `set' is applied like any other message instead of being allowed to write the
%% state directly.
%%
%% The device is written here rather than delegated to `~message@1.0', because
%% delegating means viewing this state as a message, which is another device
