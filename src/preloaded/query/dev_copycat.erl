%%% @doc A device for orchestrating indexing of messages from foreign sources
%%% into a HyperBEAM node's caches.
%%% 
%%% Supported sources of messages are as follows:
%%% - A remote Arweave GraphQL endpoint.
%%% - A remote Arweave node.
%%% Each source is implemented as a separate engine, with `dev_copycat_[ENGINE]'
%%% as the module name.
